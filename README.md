# Big Five Personality Traits Analysis
This repository contains a machine learning project aimed at identifying a person's personality type based on the Big Five personality traits model. The Big Five model, also known as the Five Factor Model, is used to describe human personality through the following dimensions:

Openness to Experience (inventive/curious vs. consistent/cautious)
Conscientiousness (efficient/organized vs. easy-going/careless)
Extroversion (outgoing/energetic vs. solitary/reserved)
Agreeableness (friendly/compassionate vs. challenging/detached)
Neuroticism (sensitive/nervous vs. secure/confident)
# Dataset
The dataset used in this project contains 19,719 responses to a personality questionnaire collected online by Open Psychometrics. The data provides valuable insights into various personality traits based on user responses.

# Project Objective
The main objective of this project is to analyze the dataset using machine learning models to predict and provide insights into the personality type of a user. The analysis will help users understand their personality traits and provide relevant information regarding their personality.
